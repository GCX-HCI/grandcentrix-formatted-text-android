# This workflow checks if the project can be built correctly and runs its unit tests and linter
# After the tests have run it prints a report in the logs and uploads a report as workflow artifact
# This workflow only runs if a Pull Request is (re-)opened and it is not a draft 
# or after a push to develop or the default branch
# For more information about best practices, see:
